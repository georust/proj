# Low-level bindings for PROJ v9.1.x

**This is a
[`*-sys`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/build-scripts.html#-sys-packages)
crate; you shouldn't use its API directly.** See the
[`proj`](https://github.com/georust/proj) crate for general use.

A guide to PROJ functions can be found here:
https://proj.org/development/reference/functions.html. 

By default, the crate will search for an acceptable existing `libproj`
installation on your system using
[pkg-config](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/). 

If an acceptable installation is not found, proj-sys will attempt to build
libproj from source bundled in the crate.

## Features

- `bundled_proj` - forces building libproj from source even if an acceptable
  version could be found on your system.  Note that SQLite3 must be
  present on your system if you wish to use this feature, and that it builds
  `libproj` **without** its native network functionality; you will have to
  implement your own set of callbacks if you wish to make use of them (see the
[`proj`](https://crates.io/crates/proj) crate for an example).
- `bundled_proj_tiff` - If the `bundled_proj` feature is enabled, adding the
  `bundled_proj_tiff` feature will build PROJ with TIFF support. Note that
  libtiff must be present on your system if you wish to use this feature.
